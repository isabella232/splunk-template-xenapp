	The host to farm lookup table is named <code>lookup_host_farm.csv</code> and correlates servers to XenApp farms.
	This is particularly helpful on the performance dashboards as the performance data gathered from Windows perfmon does not have a concept of a farm.
	The same is true for information gathered from Windows Event Logs or any data that does not have a farm concept.

	To rebuild the host to farm lookup table, choose a time range above and click submit.  You may need to choose a larger time range such as "Last 7 days".
